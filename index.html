        I Play Cypher,Sage and sometimes Brim as well. <br> My aim is to rasist enemy and take the first blood <br> if enemy attack my side.I don't give a damn <br> if enemy kills all my teammate at mid.
        99% time <br> if enemy attack my side, I take Ace. Don't belive me !!! <br> Don't ask my teammate only ask from me to insure it &#128540; .

      <p>I Play Viper,Omen,Rayna and sometimes Yuro. <br> My Aim is only slagging my teammates and sometime <br> enemy as well.I love my game play and everone does <br> it in a same manner. Once upon a time I loved to kill <br> enemy a lot. But now my only mission is line up. <br> When I kill people with lineups it gives me a demonic <br> joy! But If enemy diffuse the spike while I'm doing line <br> up! Then fuck you.</p>
